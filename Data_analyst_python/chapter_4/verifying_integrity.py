# IN python we can verify the integrity of the data by checking 
# for missing values, duplicate data, and outliers.

# For duplicate values in merge() method, we can use the validate 
# argument to check if the data is one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.

# For missing values, we can use the isnull() method to check for missing values.

# For outliers, we can use the z-score to detect outliers.


#* If we talk about concatenation, we can use the ignore_index argument to
#* reset the index of the resulting DataFrame.

# and verify_integrity argument to check if the new DataFrame has any duplicate values
